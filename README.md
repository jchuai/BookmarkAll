BookmarkAll
===========
A simple chrome plugin which allows user to bookmark all the tabs to a temp folder under the bookmark bar.
The folder will be named related with current time, like '2014-12-08 18:25:34', which would be easier for user to track the history data.

If users want to close all the tabs, but also want to keep them in memory. BookmarkAll can help you to solve the problem.
